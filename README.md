Django and React
================
This example project is built using [python-react](https://github.com/markfinger/python-react/blob/master/examples/basic_rendering/example.py).

Run `npm install`, and then `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all 
dependencies.

Then start the node server by running `node render_server`, and start the 
python server by running `python manage.py runserver`. 

Visit `localhost:8000` in your browser to see React in action :).
